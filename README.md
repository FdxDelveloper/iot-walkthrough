# Developer Experience showcase project

## Introduction

This project's goal is to show intended usage guidelines of Windows on IoT. To fulfill this goal, our solution will have two applications:

* One background application to receive sensor data and send it to the cloud. Receiving sensor data and analyzing it are important tasks in IoT and a device will often operate in "headless" mode for monitoring; thus, we separate these tasks in an independent app.
* One foreground application for user interaction. This application shows local weather (read by the background app), information from the internet (news and regional weather) and interacts with the user (playing media or showing a slideshow).

The applications are written using Universal Windows Platform (UWP); thus, the same foreground app can be run on both IoT and Desktop.
