# Software components

This project's goal is to show intended usage guidelines of Windows on IoT, including security services and integration with third-party services. The integrations come from Windows APIs, SDKs available for UWP or use of REST APIs. The following integrations will be used:

| Service               | Used features                                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure                 | Log sensor data, save settings on the cloud and fetch API keys  |
| Open Weather Maps     | Fetch weather condition                                         |
