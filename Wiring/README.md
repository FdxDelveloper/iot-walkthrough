# Wiring of weather shield to DragonBoard 410c

### Introduction
In this project, we will use a weather shield containing a HTU21D(F) humidity and temperature sensor and a MPL3115A2 pressure sensor connected to a I2C bus. We will use the [SparkFun weather shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12081), which provides these two sensors and a light sensor. The GPIO of the DragonBoard includes the required I2C buses and 5V port to power the shield.

### Components
To connect the sensor to the DragonBoard, a level shifter will be necessary. The DragonBoard GPIO operates at 1.8V, while the weather shield outputs operate at 5V. A bidirectional level shifter is required due to the open drain nature of I2C, where both the master or the devices might pull the line low. A [Adafruit 4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/757) will be used.

* The *GND* signals of both boards are connected.
* On the DragonBoard side, *LV* is connected to *1.8V*, and *A1* and *A2* are connected to *SCL* and *SDA*, respectively.
* On the weather shield side, *HV* is connected to *5V*, and *B1* and *B2* are connected to *SCL* and *SDA*, respectively.
* The DragonBoard's *5V* output is connected to *5V* and *VIN* of the weather shield.
